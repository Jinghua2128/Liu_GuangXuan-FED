                            <div class="blog-slider_text">I was born in Pu Yang, He Nan, China, and spent my early childhood in a small village called Qingzu.
                                I lived a simple and carefree life, surrounded by the beauty of rural China. My world back then was small,mostly revolving 
                                around my family, friends, and the toys I loved to play with. Life was filled with laughter, games, and watching cartoons.

                            <div class="blog-slider_text">At this stage, my perspective was limited‚ÄîI hadn't yet opened my eyes to the vast world beyond my 
                                village. I didn't have any sense of the larger world, but I was content with the little things in my environment. My days 
                                were about enjoying the present, learning from those around me, and cherishing the closeness of family.Though my early life
                                was spent in a rural setting, the experiences and bonds I formed there laid the foundation for the person I am today. I may 
                                not have realized it back then, but those moments were quietly shaping my curiosity and desire to explore the world.</div>
