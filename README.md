This project is part of the Front-End Development module at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. It demonstrates the application of essential web development concepts, focusing on building a functional, interactive, and visually engaging website.

Project Overview
The website aims to serve as a personal blog, showcasing creative projects, contact information, and personal insights.
